# Active Model

## What is Active Model?

- Active Model is a Ruby library that provides model-like behavior to plain Ruby objects without requiring a database. It extracts useful functionalities from Active Record and allows developers to implement features like validations, callbacks, and custom attributes in non-database-backed models.

## Relationship with Active Record

**Active Record**: An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that connects objects to relational database tables.

**Active Model**: A set of modules extracted from Active Record to provide model-like behavior without requiring a database.

## Key Features of Active Model

**Validations**: Enables checking constraints on object attributes.

**Callbacks**: Hooks to trigger actions at different points in an object's lifecycle.

**Translations**: Provides internationalization (i18n) support.

**Custom Attributes**: Allows defining dynamic attributes in plain Ruby objects.
